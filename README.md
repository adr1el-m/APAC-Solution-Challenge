Our computer vision system instantly identifies crop diseases with 99% accuracy. Using Google's Gemini multimodal technology, farmers can simply scan any plant with their phone camera to get immediate diagnosis and treatment recommendations.

- **Key Features:**
  - Real-time disease identification
  - Treatment recommendations
  - Historical tracking of plant health
  - Works with 500+ crop varieties and diseases

### 2. Smart Irrigation System

Our IoT-based irrigation management system optimizes water usage based on real-time data and AI analysis, reducing water consumption by up to 60% while improving crop health.

- **Key Features:**
  - Precision watering based on soil moisture, weather, and crop needs
  - Automated scheduling with manual override
  - Water usage analytics and savings reports
  - Drought prediction and mitigation

### 3. Intelligent Crop Advisory

AI-driven recommendations personalized to specific farm conditions that increase yields by 30% on average. Suggestions include optimal planting schedules, fertilizer applications, and harvesting times.

- **Key Features:**
  - Personalized crop variety suggestions
  - Fertilization schedules
  - Yield predictions
  - Market insights and profit optimization
